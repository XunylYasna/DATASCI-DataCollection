# DATASCI-DataCollection

Simple exercise for collecting data through web scraping and using APIs.

For the first exercise, we were tasked of scraping Bulbapedia. This method was shown on our previous lectures.

For the second exercise, we were tasked of collecting news articles published on March 11-12. Our professor gave us more leeway so I decided to use the API provided by https://newsapi.org/.
